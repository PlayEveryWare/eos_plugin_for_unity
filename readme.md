# Configuring the Plugin

To get the EOS working, the plugin needs to know some specific things about your EOS project.

## Prerequisites
* One has a Unity project one would like to have the plugin integrated into
* One has a Epic Games Account, which you may sign up for [here](https://dev.epicgames.com/portal/)
* One has accepted the Terms for the [Epic Online Services](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/tos?lang=en-US)
* One has configured a product on the [Epic Games Developer Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/portal/)

## Steps
1) Open your Unity project with integrated plugin 
2) In the Unity editor, Open ```Tools -> EpicOnlineServicesConfigEditor```

    ![EOS Config Menu](docs/images/unity_tools_eosconfig.gif)

3) Configure the EOS plugin

    ![EOS Config UI](docs/images/eosconfig_ui.gif)

4) From the [developer portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/portal/), copy the configuration values listed below, and paste them into the similarly named fields in the editor tool:
    * ProductName
    * ProductVersion
    * [ProductID](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/services/en-US/Glossary/index.html#D?term=ProductId)
    * [SandboxID](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/services/en-US/Glossary/index.html#D?term=SandboxId)
    * [DeploymentID](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/services/en-US/Glossary/index.html#D?term=DeploymentId)
    * [ClientSecret](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/services/en-US/Glossary/index.html#D?term=ClientSecret)
    * [ClientID](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/services/en-US/Glossary/index.html#D?term=ClientId)

5) If you've already configured an encryption key in the EOS portal, enter it into the Encryption Key field. Otherwise, click the Generate button to make a random one.
   
At this point, you are ready to start developing using the Epic Online Services Plugin for Unity!  Simply attach <code>EOSManager.cs (Script)</code> to a Unity object and it will intialize the plugin with the specified configuration in <code>OnAwake()</code>.

If you would like to see examples of each feature, continue installing samples below.

# Samples

The included samples show fully functional feature implemenation that will both help with EOS integration as well as validate client to dev portal configuration.  After installing the samples from the UPM package, you will find scenes for each major feature.

<img src="docs/images/sample_screen_lobby.gif" alt="Lobby Screenshot" width="48%"/>
<img src="docs/images/sample_screen_titlestorage.gif" alt="Title Storage Screenshot" width="48%"/>

In addition, the samples include Unity friendly *feature* Managers that can help to quickly integrate new EOS features into your title.  They provide functional usage of the main feature functionality and can be a good base template.

## Installing the samples
To use the samples, install them from the UPM manager.

![Unity Install Samples](docs/images/unity_install_samples.gif)

The samples include both usage of the EOS SDK, and convience wrappers to make using the SDK more ergonomic in the Unity Game Engine. By being samples in the UPM sense, they are placed under Assets which allows modification.

## Running the samples
* Launch Unity project with the samples installed

* In the Unity editor, hit ```Play```

* Login with a selected authentication type

    ![Auth and Friends Screenshot](docs/images/sample_screen_auth_friends.gif)

# Authentication


## Running and Configuring the EOS SDK Dev Auth Tool
* Launch the [Developer Authentication Tool](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/services/en-US/EpicAccountServices/DeveloperAuthenticationTool/index.html)

    ![Dev Auth Tool](docs/images/dev_auth_tool.gif)

* Pick a port to use on the computer. 8888 is a good quick to type number that isn't usually used by a process
* Log in with one's user credentials that are registered with Epic
* Pick a username. This username will be used in the sample to log in

More specific and up-to-date instructions can also be found on Epic's [website](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/services/en-US/EpicAccountServices/DeveloperAuthenticationTool/index.html)
