PlayEveryWare Sessions & Matchmaking Epic Online Services Demo

This demo is intended to show the Sessions & Matchmaking function of the EOS Plugin for Unity through a faux session an matchmaking application.
A sample of the Sessions interface can be found in the EOSSessionsManager script.

How to use:
Select a login type
    Dev Auth uses the Dev Auth tool that comes with the EOS SDK
    Account Portal uses the popup Epic window
    Persistent uses the most recent logged in information

Once logged in you can start using the demo, the friends list on the right should contain your Epic friends list, it is recommended
that you have 2 accounts set up to run the app in parallel, as only one instance of the demo cannot do much on its own. 

Using the menu in the top left you can create a session by choosing a name and selecting any options you would like. 
Other users can then search by the level name and join if the match has not been started, or if join in progress has been selected.
