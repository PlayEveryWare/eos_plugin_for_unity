PlayEveryWare Player Reports & Sanctions Epic Online Services Demo

This demo is intended to show the Player Reports & Sanctions function of the EOS Plugin for Unity through a friends list report application.
A sample of the Player Reports and Sanctions interfaces can be found in the EOSReportsManager script.

How to use:
Select a login type
    Dev Auth uses the Dev Auth tool that comes with the EOS SDK
    Account Portal uses the popup Epic window
    Persistent uses the most recent logged in information

If you are getting a error logging in pertaining to the EOS Overlay, this is caused by the overlay not being installed yet. 
To install it create a build of the demo and run the bootstrapper included in the build folder, this will install the overlay.

Once logged in you can start using the demo, the friends list on the right should contain your Epic friends list, it is recommended
that you have 2 accounts set up to run the app in parallel, as only one instance of the demo cannot do much on its own. 

The demo allows you to report accounts on your friends list by clicking the report button next to their name on the right.
You can then fill out a message, select the report type and submit it as well as view any sanctions that account has.
