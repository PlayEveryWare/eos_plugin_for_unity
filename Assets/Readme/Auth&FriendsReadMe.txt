PlayEveryWare Auth & Friends Epic Online Services Demo

This demo is intended to show the Friends function of the EOS Plugin for unity through a friends list application.
A sample of the Friends interface can be found in the EOSFriendsManager script.

How to use:
Select a login type
    Dev Auth uses the Dev Auth tool that comes with the EOS SDK
    Account Portal uses the popup Epic window
    Persistent uses the most recent logged in information

If you are getting a error logging in pertaining to the EOS Overlay, this is caused by the overlay not being installed yet. 
To install it create a build of the demo and run the bootstrapper included in the build folder, this will install the overlay.

Once logged in you can start using the demo, the friends list on the right should contain your Epic friends list, it is recommended
that you have 2 accounts set up to run the app in parallel, as only one instance of the demo cannot do much on its own. 

You can click the friends overlay to enter the Epic Games Friends overlay and manage your friend list, changes in this list should be mirrored into the application.
The application should show any friends you have and if they are online or offline.
