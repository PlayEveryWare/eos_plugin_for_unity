PlayEveryWare Lobbies Epic Online Services Demo

This demo is intended to show the Lobby function of the EOS Plugin for Unity through a faux game lobby application.
A sample of the Lobby interface can be found in the EOSLobbyManager script.

How to use:
Select a login type
    Dev Auth uses the Dev Auth tool that comes with the EOS SDK
    Account Portal uses the popup Epic window
    Persistent uses the most recent logged in information

If you are getting a error logging in pertaining to the EOS Overlay, this is caused by the overlay not being installed yet. 
To install it create a build of the demo and run the bootstrapper included in the build folder, this will install the overlay.

Once logged in you can start using the demo, the friends list on the right should contain your Epic friends list, it is recommended
that you have 2 accounts set up to run the app in parallel, as only one instance of the demo cannot do much on its own. 

Users can create a lobby by choosing a BucketID, and choosing any options they want and clicking "Create Lobby" Other users can then search of that lobby.
This is done using the search options on the right side, and any results will be listed below. 
Once in a lobby if it is enabled users will be able to talk over voice chat and individually silence others or themselves, and the lobby owner can promote or kick users.
