The Player Data Storage Interface provides a method of saving and loaded data stored on the EOS Player Data Storage Service. Files on the Player Data Storage Service are user-specific, which differentiates them from the game-specific files of the Title Storage Service.

To use the Player Data Storage sample, you will need to set an encryption key in the EOS Config Editor. If you haven't entered one yet, you can click the Generate button to create a valid 64 character hex key.

After logging in, the sample provides some example functionality for user data access. Enter a file name in the indicated field, and click the New Inventory File button. This will create a new file containing a sample JSON object exemplifying a basic user inventory and upload it to the user's data storage. After files have been created, click on of the file name buttons in the Files section to download and view the data in the Remove View section. You can also press the Refresh button to update the list of files from the server, or the Duplicate or Delete buttons to copy or remove the selected file on the server. Press the Download button to make a local copy of the files contents if they are a valid inventory JSON. You can then use the Add Item button and the corresponding dropdown menu to select and add items to the local inventory. The Upload button can then be used to send the new file contents to the server and overwrite the file there.
