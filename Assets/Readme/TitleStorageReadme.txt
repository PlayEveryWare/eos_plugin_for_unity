The Title Storage Service provides a method for the developer to upload files to the EOS developer portal and access them in a game client using the Title Storage Interface. Files on the Title Storage Service are game-specific, which differentiates them from the user-specific files of the Player Data Storage Service.

To use the Title Storage sample, you will need to have uploaded one or more files to the EOS dev portal. This can be found on the dev portal at <Product Name>/Game Services/Title Storage. When uploading or changing files in the portal, you will be prompted for an encryption key. Use the same key that you provided in the EOS Config Editor. If you haven't entered one yet, you can click the Generate button to create a valid 64 character hex key. After creating some files in the EOS portal, you can add tags to them which can be used to query them in the client. Files can also be given overrides based on client, so different builds of your game can be redirected to different files when downloading them.

After logging in, the sample provides two main method of accessing files. You can enter the exact file name in the indicated field, click View Contents, and the file will be downloaded and displayed in the File Content box. Alternatively, you can enter one or more tags by name in the indicated field and click Query List. A list of uploaded files containing at least one of the specified tags will be listed in the Files box. Click one of the file names, and it will be used to populate the file name box, after which View Contents can be clicked to view it. A tag specifying the current platform can be added with the Add Platform Tag button, and you can add the corresponding tag in the EOS dev portal to filter files by platform.
