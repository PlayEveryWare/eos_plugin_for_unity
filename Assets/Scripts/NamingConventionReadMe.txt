EOS Demo Naming conventions:

Classes with a leading 'UI' are classes that hold or do UI related things
Classes ending with 'Menu' are the main classes that hold the sample's UI code
Classes ending with 'Entry' are UI list entries. 
Classes ending with 'Manager' Handle interactions with the EOS SDK and are potentially shared across samples

For example: UIKeyboard is a script that deals with the UI keyboard
			 Peer2PeerManager handles the EOS side of the Peer 2 Peer demo scene
