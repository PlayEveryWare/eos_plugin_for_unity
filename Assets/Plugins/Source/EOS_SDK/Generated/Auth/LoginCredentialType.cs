		/// @details The flow is as following:
		/// 1. Game initiates the user login flow by calling <see cref="AuthInterface.Login" /> API with the <see cref="DeviceCode" /> login type.
		/// 2. The SDK internally requests the authentication backend service to begin the login flow, and returns the game
		/// a new randomly generated device code along with authorization URL information needed to complete the flow.

		/// will be set to <see cref="Result.AuthPinGrantCode" /> and the <see cref="PinGrantInfo" /> struct will contain the needed information.
		/// 3. Game presents the device code and the authorization URL information on screen to the end-user.
		/// 4. The user will login to their Epic Account using an external device, e.g. a mobile device or a desktop PC,
		/// by browsing to the presented authentication URL and entering the device code presented by the game on the console.
		/// 5. Once the user has successfully logged in on their external device, the SDK will call the <see cref="AuthInterface.Login" /> callback

		/// 
		/// @details After logging in a local user for the first time, the game can remember the user login to allow automatically logging
		/// in the same user the next time they start the game. This avoids prompting the same user to go through the login flow
		/// across multiple game sessions over long periods of time.
		/// To do this, after a successful login using the <see cref="DeviceCode" /> login type, the game can call the <see cref="AuthInterface.CopyUserAuthToken" /> API
		/// to retrieve a long-lived refresh token that is specifically created for this purpose on Console. The game can store
		/// the long-lived refresh token locally on the device, for the currently logged in local user of the device.
		/// Then, on subsequent game starts the game can call the <see cref="AuthInterface.Login" /> API with the previously stored refresh token and

		/// - During the login process, the user will be able to login to their existing Epic account or create a new account if needed.
		/// 4. <see cref="AuthInterface.LinkAccount" /> will make an intermediate callback to provide the caller with <see cref="PinGrantInfo" /> struct set in the <see cref="LoginCallbackInfo" /> data.
		/// 5. Game examines the retrieved <see cref="PinGrantInfo" /> struct for a website URI and user code that the user needs to access off-device via a PC or mobile device.
		/// - Game visualizes the URI and user code so that the user can proceed with the login flow outside the console.
		/// - In the meantime, EOS SDK will internally keep polling the backend for a completion status of the login flow.
		/// 6. Once user completes the login, cancels it or if the login flow times out, <see cref="AuthInterface.LinkAccount" /> makes the second and final callback to the caller with the operation result status.
		/// - If the user was logged in successfully, <see cref="Result.Success" /> is returned in the <see cref="LoginCallbackInfo" />. Otherwise, an error result code is returned accordingly.
