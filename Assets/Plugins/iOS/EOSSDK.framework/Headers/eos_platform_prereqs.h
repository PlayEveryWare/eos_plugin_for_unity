 * on platform specific development.
 *
 * Some platforms need additional setup before `eos_base.h` is called.
 * The `eos_base.h` header is included by all EOS SDK headers.  This header
 * file provides one way of allowing cross platform development with minimal
 * setup.
 *
 * To use this add the EOS_BUILD_PLATFORM_NAME define when building platforms
 * which need to include a `<Platform>/eos_<Platform>_base.h`. The value of
 * EOS_BUILD_PLATFORM_NAME will be placed in the `<Platform>` spot.  Not all
 * platforms need one of these base header files. Blank files are still provided
 * for the platforms that do not require it.
 *
 * Alternatives to this header are to have the necessary file explicitly
 * included.  This is a good solution if only a single platform is needed.
 * For example:
 *   #include "ThePlatform/eos_ThePlatform_base.h"
 *   #include "eos_sdk.h"
 *   #include "eos_friends_types.h"
 *
 * Another option is to use the macros provided by the custom compiler to
 * determine which include to use.
 * For example:
 *   #if defined(__THECOMPILER__)
 *   #include "ThePlatform/eos_ThePlatform_base.h"
 *   #elif defined(__SOMECOMPILER__)
 *   #include "SomePlatform/eos_SomePlatform_base.h"
 *   #endif
 *   #include "eos_sdk.h"
 *   #include "eos_friends_types.h"
