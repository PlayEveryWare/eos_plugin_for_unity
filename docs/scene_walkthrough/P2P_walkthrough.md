## **Peer 2 Peer Demo**
The Peer 2 Peer demo showcases the peer 2 peer interface. This is done through a basic messaging application where users can chat with other users on their friend list.
- The Right window is the friends list, from here you can click the ``Chat`` button to open a chat window with the selected friend.
- The top text field allows you to open a chat window with another user using only their ID.
- The central area is where chat windows will appear, with a text field at the bottom to send messages through and a chat log above that.
