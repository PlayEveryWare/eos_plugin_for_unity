# How to configure Easy Anti-Cheat

The EOS plugin provides a method of automating EAC installation as part of the build process for Windows, Mac and Linux platforms. First, some additional configuration is required.

## Prerequisites
* [Enable EAC modules](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/game-services/anti-cheat/using-anti-cheat#set-up-update-and-revert-your-client-module) for your desired platforms and [activate client protection](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/game-services/anti-cheat/using-anti-cheat#anti-cheat-service-configuration-in-developer-portal).
* Make sure the Anti-Cheat interface is enabled in your [client policy](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/dev-portal/client-credentials#policies).
* [Download your EAC integrity keys.](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/game-services/anti-cheat/using-anti-cheat#configure-your-integrity-tool) Make sure to store your private key in a secure manner, as making it public will allow players to bypass client protection.

# Steps
1) Open your Unity project with the plugin installed.
2) Open the editor preferences settings for the plugin, which is avaiable in Preferences->EOS Plugin. All EAC options are located under the Tools subheader.
3) Enable EAC build steps by checking the `Use EAC` toggle.
4) Set `Path to EAC private key` and `Path to EAC Certificate` to the private and public keys you previosuly downloaded, respectively.
5) (Recommended) Set `Path to EAC splash image` to a 800x450 PNG that will display in the EAC launcher.
6) (Optional)
    1) If you want to customize the config for EAC integrity tool, you can copy the default config from `Packages/Epic Online Services Plugin for Unity/Editor/Standalone/anticheat_integritytool.cfg` to your desired location, customize it, and set `Path to EAC Integrity Tool Config` to the new file.
    2) If you've downloaded the integrity tool yourself and want to use that, the path can be set via `Path to EAC Integrity Tool`.

If the integrity tool was configured incorrectly, the Anti-Cheat interface should print a warning message after EOS initialization.
