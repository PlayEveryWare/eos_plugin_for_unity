## **Metrics Demo**
The Metrics demo showcases the player metrics interface, allowing for game use and analytical data to be collected. This data can then be accessed through the developer portal for the product.
- ``Display Name`` Allows the user to choose what name their account is tied to.
- ``Controller Type`` Allows the user to select the control type they use.
- ``Server IP`` would be used to store the ip of the game server the player is using.
- ``Game Session ID`` can be used to attach a specific match identifiers to the metric session.
