## **P2P Netcode Demo**
This demo showcases the Peer 2 Peer interface working with Unity's netcode. This is done through a simple game where players can move a square around the screen.
- The ``Start Hosting`` button starts hosting a game on the local machine.
- The ``Take Control`` button directs input towards the square allowing the user to move it around.
- The ``Release Control`` button releases control of the square allowing input to be directed elsewhere.
- The ``Join`` button in the friends tab allows the user to join a friend who is hosting a game.
