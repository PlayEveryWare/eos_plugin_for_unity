    - The ``Bucket ID`` Is the name or lobby ID used to find the lobby through search functions.
    - The ``Max Players`` Drowpdown selects the maximum number of user the lobby will be able to hold.
    - The ``Level`` dropdown selects the level the lobby will work on, this is also used for searching for lobbies through search functions.
    - The ``Permission`` dropdown selects how user are able to join the lobby.
        - ``Public`` Allows anyone to join.
        - ``Join via Presence`` Allows only friends to join (Presence is the term used for the entire friends/status interface).
        - ``Invite Only`` Allows only users who have been sent an invite from a player in the lobby to join.

    - ``Anti-Cheat Enabled`` toggles Easy-Anti Cheat on and off. This will kick cheating players or leave the lobby if the owner is cheating.
    - ``Create New Lobby`` Creates and joins a new lobby with the selected settings (Note: With default settings, only a bucket id is needed to create a new lobby).
