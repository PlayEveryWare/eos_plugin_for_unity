## Disabling Steam integration
To disable Steam integration functionality, delete the configuration `Assets/StreamingAssets/EOS/eos_steam_config.json` before building.

## Overriding Sandbox and Deployment IDs
At runtime, the sandbox ID can be overridden with the launch argument `-eossandboxid=<id>` and the deployment ID with `-eosdeploymentid=<id>`. 

To specify deployment IDs in this case, Sandbox Deployment Overrides can be added in the plugin config editor to define sandbox-deployment pairs, which will override the deployment ID when a given sandbox ID is used.
