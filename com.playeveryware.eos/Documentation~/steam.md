# Steam Integration

The EOS(Epic Online Services) SDK supports logging in with a Steam Account and several other Steam functionalities.  

This document is a guide to connect the dots between EOS SDK and Steam SDK.  

## Prerequisites

- Install Steam SDK version `1.57` minimum.  
- Have Steam added as an [Indentity Provider](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/dev-portal/identity-provider-management#steam) for your game.

## External C# Wrappers for the Steam SDK

The Steam SDK includes C++ libraries which needs C# wrappers to work in Unity.  
There are several open source C# wrappers available.  

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure that the minimum Steam SDK version `1.57` is supported by the wrappers if you are using one.
