## Why does the plugin fail to work after changing configuration?

To rerun in UnityEditor without rebooting, we must reload the EOS SDK dll between runs.  
To find out why and how to do so look see our documentation on [Unity Specific aspects of implementing EOS](https://github.com/PlayEveryWare/eos_plugin_for_unity/blob/development/com.playeveryware.eos/Documentation~/unity_specific.md).

## How do I override sandbox or deployment IDs when publishing on the Epic Games Store?

This functionality is outlined in our [document on the Epic Game Store](/com.playeveryware.eos/Documentation~/epic_game_store.md#overriding-sandbox-andor-deployment-id).

## How do I get the Epic Username?
It depends on what one means by "Username".

If one means a name that's displayable to the user, a.k.a. a display name, then the following 
code should suffice, assuming one has already logged in:

```cs
var userInfoManager = EOSManager.Instance.GetOrCreateManager<EOSUserInfoManager>();
var userInfo = userInfoManager.GetLocalUserInfo();

if (UserInfo.UserId?.IsValid() == true)
{
    DisplayNameText.text = UserInfo.DisplayName;
}
```

However, if one means "Epic username that's passed to the app via the Epic Launcher", there is a method in
`EOSManager` that one may use.

```cs
var epicLauncherArgs = EOSManager.instance.GetCommandLineArgsFromEpicLauncher()
string epicUsername = epicLauncherArgs.epicUsername;
```

This will get whatever username is passed on the command line from Epic.

## Can a title pass a custom device ID? How does one do that?
A title can pass a custom device ID, but must be sure that the ID is unique to the device.
For example, assuming `CoolMethodThatCreatesAUniqueDeviceID` is method that the title has written to generate
a unique string that can identify the device:

```cs
private void CreateCustomDeviceID()
{
    var connectInterface = EOSManager.Instance.GetEOSConnectInterface();
    var options = new Epic.OnlineServices.Connect.CreateDeviceIdOptions()
    {
        DeviceModel = CoolMethodThatCreatesAUniqueDeviceID()
    };

    connectInterface.CreateDeviceId(ref options, null, CreateDeviceCallback);
}
```

More specific information can be found in [Epic's documentation](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/api-ref/functions/eos-connect-create-device-id).

## Are there alternatives to storing the config files in Streaming Assets? Why is the file there?
Quick summary: Those values are not as 'secret' as one might assume, and it's somewhat safe to have them in the open. 

The config file has to be in StreamingAssets so that the GfxPluginNativeRender can access the values in it before 
all of Unity has been bootstrapped so that the Plugin can hook all the appropriate things before the first graphics call by the Unity engine.

> [!NOTE]
> See [eos_config_security.md](/com.playeveryware.eos/Documentation~/eos_config_security.md) for more information. 

## Why does the Demo Scene fail to load?

There is a standard sample pack, and several extra packs in the EOS Unity Plugin. If a scene doesn't load, remember to import the wanted extra pack.
Additionally, make sure all wanted sample scenes are included in the build settings as shown in steps 4.-6. of <a href="/com.playeveryware.eos/README.md#importing-samples">Importing the samples</a>.

## What is the correct way to log into the Epic Games Store?
The correct way to connect to the Epic Games Store through your application would be to use the exchange code login method:

### Exchange Code

`Exchange Code` login could be used when launching the game through Epic Games Launcher on desktop platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)  
The required exchange code could be retrieved with `GetCommandLineArgsFromEpicLauncher()`

```cs
EOSManager.Instance.StartLoginWithLoginTypeAndToken(
    loginType,
    null, // Intended for UserID, but is unused for Exchange Code login
    EOSManager.Instance.GetCommandLineArgsFromEpicLauncher().authPassword, // The exchange code itself, passed as login token
    StartLoginWithLoginTypeAndTokenCallback);
``` 

## Do I or my players need an Epic Games Account?

### As a developer
As a developer you will need to have an Epic Games account in order to interact with the [EOS Developer Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/portal) and manage your product.

### As a player
Players are given multiple login options, which are slightly different from platform to platform. Details of which login methods are supported by each platform are listed in our documentation outlining [login type by platform](/com.playeveryware.eos/Documentation~/login_type_by_platform.md).

## What does the "DllNotFoundException" error mean? 

This might be caused by libraries/binaries not being fetched from git lfs.  
Which mainly happens when adding the UPM `via git url`   

To fix this you may do one of the following:

- Initialize git lfs on the package folder (from a command window `git lfs install`).
- Add the UPM `via tarball` downloaded the [releases](https://github.com/PlayEveryWare/eos_plugin_for_unity/releases) on GitHub instead.

## Why am I getting Overlay Errors?
Overlay errors are most likely due to not having the overlay installed, this is done in two steps:
 1. Install the [Epic Games Store](https://store.epicgames.com/) application.
 2. Run the `EOSBootstrapper.exe` that is generated with a build before running the application.

## Missing Native Libraries?

Some native functionality are required for platform specific needs.  

To get these dependent libraries, use the platform library build tool in the plugin at `Tools > EOS Plugin > Build Library > [Target Platform]`

Or to install the libraries manually, go to the `lib/NativeCode` folder, find the target platform, and *build the `.sln`* or *`run the makefile`* in the folder.

## How do I debug the native DLL?

1. Get code for the eos samples.
2. Set build configuration to `Debug`
3. Set `SHOW_DIALOG_BOX_ON_WARN` to `1`.
2. Build the Visual Studio project.
3. Copy the DLL to a version of the exported project to debug.
4. After launch, attach to the project after the dialog box appears.

## How do I disable the Overlay?

On the EOS Configuration Editor Window there is a setting for `Platform Flags`. By adding `DisableOverlay` to your list of Platform Flags, the Epic Overlay will not be initialized during runtime. When this is configured the `EOSBootstrapper.exe` will not be included in Windows builds.

See [`PlatformFlags.cs`](/com.playeveryware.eos/Runtime/EOS_SDK/Generated/Platform/PlatformFlags.cs)
