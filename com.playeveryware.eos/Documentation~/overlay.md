If you are getting a error logging in pertaining to the EOS Overlay, this is caused by one or two things:
- The overlay is not yet installed. 
    - To install it create a build of the demo and run the bootstrapper included in the build folder, this will install the overlay.
- Epic Games Launcher is not installed.
    - The launcher can be downloaded here: [Download Epic Games Launcher](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/download).
