## Importing the Plugin


There are two options to install the package, from a <a href="#adding-the-package-from-a-tarball">tarball</a> [Quickest to start], or from a <a href="#adding-the-package-from-a-git-url">GIT URL</a> [Quickest for updates].

## Adding the package from a tarball
<br />

1. Download the latest release tarball, ```"com.playeveryware.eos-[version].tgz"``` [here](https://github.com/PlayEveryWare/eos_plugin_for_unity/releases).
    > :heavy_exclamation_mark: If one uses the source download it will be missing all the git-lfs files (i.e. binaries, dynamic libraries). 

2. Move the downloaded tarball into your project folder, but outside of the ```Assets``` folder.

3. From the Unity Editor, open the Package Manager.
    * ```Window -> Package Manager```

      ![unity tools package manager](docs/images/unity_tools_package_manager.gif)

## Samples

<img src="docs/images/sample_screen_lobby.gif" alt="Lobby Screenshot" width="48%"/> <img src="docs/images/sample_screen_achievements.gif" alt="Achievements Storage Screenshot" width="48%"/>

The included samples show examples of fully functional <a href="#supported-eos-sdk-features">feature implementation</a> to validate client and dev portal configuration as well as help with EOS integration into your own project. The samples are a collection of scenes that are imported from the UPM package, and include a series of scripts that function as generalized managers for each supported EOS SDK feature and platform.

   > :heavy_exclamation_mark: The generalized managers are a great starting point for feature integration into your own project. They are named as ```EOS[Feature/Platform name]Manager.cs```.

<br />

## Importing the samples
<br />

1. Select the ```PlayEveryWare EOS Plugin for Unity``` in the Package Manager window.

    ![Unity Install Samples](docs/images/unity_install_samples.gif)

2. Open the ```Samples``` dropdown.

3. Select ```Import``` for each of the sample packs, to bring in the Sample scenes.

    > :heavy_exclamation_mark: The samples are placed in ```Assets/Samples``` for personal modification.

4. In the Unity editor menu bar, open ```File->Build Settings```.

5. In the ```Project``` window, navigate to the scenes folders containing their respective sample scenes. ```\Assets\Samples\PlayEveryWare EOS Plugin for Unity\[Version #]\[Pack Name]\Scenes```.

6. Add the scenes to the ```Scenes In Build``` section of the ```Build Settings``` window. This can be done quickly by using the ```Shift``` key to select each scene at the same time, then dragging them into the proper area. Repeating for each sample pack folder.

    > :heavy_exclamation_mark: If you have other scenes already, and plan to look at the samples in a build, drag a sample scene to be the 0th scene in Build Settings before you build.

<br />

## Running the samples

> :heavy_exclamation_mark: The plugin must be <a href="#configuring-the-plugin">configured</a> for samples to be functional.

> :heavy_exclamation_mark: Some Samples may not be accessible if the extra packs were not <a href="#importing-the-samples">imported</a>, or the scenes weren't added in the build settings. 

Sample walkthroughs can be found [here](docs/Walkthrough.md).

<details>
  <summary><b>Steps to run a sample in editor</b></summary>

> :heavy_exclamation_mark: The Social Overlay Feature is not supported in editor.

1. In the Unity editor, open the desired sample scene from the imported Scenes folder.

2. Press the play button at the top of the editor.

3. Login with a selected authentication type. <br />```Account Portal``` and then ```PersistentAuth``` is easiest for the first time. ```Dev Auth``` can be used for quicker iteration, among other options described [here](docs/Walkthrough.md), to explore features that don't require an Epic Games Account, or the options to choose for closer representation to the user experience on specific platform releases.

<br />

  > :heavy_exclamation_mark: Check the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) as there may be specific requirements for a player's computer.
  >  Windows, for instance, requires the players to have ```The latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable``` installed on their computer in order to play any distributed builds.

1. In the Unity editor menu bar, open ```File->Build Settings```.
  
    > :heavy_exclamation_mark: If you have non-sample scenes, drag a sample scene to be the 0th scene in Build Settings before you build.

2. Choose your desired platform, and settings, hitting ```Build``` as you normally would.

3. Run your build.

    > :heavy_exclamation_mark: A Windows build, is started by running the ```EOSBootstrapper``` application in the resulting build, and not the game application itself. it is for this and similar reasons that the ```Build And Run``` button may not always function as it usually would.

4.  Login with a selected authentication type. <br />```Account Portal``` and then ```PersistentAuth``` is easiest for the first time. ```Dev Auth``` can be used for quicker iteration, among other options described [here](docs/Walkthrough.md), to explore features that don't require an Epic Games Account, or the options to choose for closer representation to the user experience on specific platform releases.

     ![Auth and Friends Screenshot](docs/images/sample_screen_account_login.gif)
